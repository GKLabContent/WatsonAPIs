SwiftService Trucking unveiled its same-day delivery service in 2015, but two years later, it’s only being used in four cities, although the company has locations in 47 states. The company blames the slow startup on recent competition from smaller trucking companies and having no nationally recognized brand.

BestFreight’s rush-delivery service was almost cancelled shortly after it went to market – until one of its less seasoned employees had a great idea of allowing customers to use a mobile app to schedule a rush delivery. While the service can be pricey, it’s really based on zones. In NYC, for example, if a package is delivered within the same zone of Queens, your delivery will be the same no matter where it is in that borough.

The trucking industry is abuzz with talk that same-day delivery will be the next standard for fulfilling orders, but many trucking companies struggle to see the viability of offering this service as a long-term business model. Many key questions about the service, such as, "Will customers use it?" and "Are they willing to digest the extra cost?" remain unanswered.
