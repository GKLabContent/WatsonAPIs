Dress Code
We want our drivers to be relaxed and comfortable. Although Wunhill does not have a uniform, we do require you to follow our dress code.
We recommend you buy good quality work boots and gloves. Work boots should have non-skid, oil-resistant soles. Double-layer gloves are recommended for winter.
Ensure that you keep a bag of extra clothing for extreme weather.

Leave Policy
Wunhill drivers earn 1 day of paid time off for every 10 driving days.
Wunhill drivers earn 4 paid sick days per year.
Managers must be notified of scheduled leave one week ahead of time.
Wunhill drivers may be asked to work on holidays if routes and schedules demand it. Drivers receive double time for holiday driving days.
