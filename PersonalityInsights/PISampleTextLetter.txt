Dear Mr. Wallace,
When I heard about the business internship with Wunhill Distribution, I was truly excited by the opportunity to complement my coursework with practical experience. As a high-school junior on a Business track at Greenville High School, I am interested in gaining experience in all aspects of your business, from HR to marketing and from finance to operations. I believe my coursework, leadership experience, and communication skills have prepared me well for this position. Here is a sample of my accomplishments:
- Academic coursework: I have completed courses in research, accounting, and marketing, with an overall a 3.7 GPA.
- Leadership experience: As a Girl Scout leader, and member of the German Club and Student Government Association, I am experienced in collaborating with my peers and young business leaders to improve the quality of life for people in my community.
- Communication and presentation skills: I am a stronger presenter for both small and large groups and am skilled in communicating via phone and face-to-face.
- Awards and recognition:
- Volunteer of the month March 2016
- Outstanding German student, 2015
- Honor roll, 8 quarters
My enclosed resume further explains my academic coursework, leadership experience, and communication skills. I hope you will consider me for this internship, as I think I have the blend of skills and experience you’re looking for.
Thank you so much for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,
Jordan Markett
