Sometimes, the internal threads of a nut or bolt hole can become stripped, usually from overtightening. When this happens, you have two choices: 
1. Drill  and tap the hole to the next suitable oversize and install a larger diameter bolt, screw, or stud.
2. Drill and tap the hole to accept a threaded plug, then drill and tap the plug to the original screw size. Then you simply drill a hole to the specified size, then run the threaded plug into the hole with a bolt and jam nut.
