Dear Mr. Matthews,
I am writing to inform you about a delay in delivery on June 2, 2017. Wunhill was scheduled to deliver a large shipment of Cavendish bananas by 11 a.m. on June 2. Not only was the crate of bananas not delivered until 4 p.m. that day, but also, I was given no advanced notice that the shipment would be late.
These issues caused significant hardship for myself and my staff, as I had two of my employees waiting in the shipping department for almost two hours waiting to offload the crate.
At this point, I am requesting that Wunhill compensate my store in the amount of $226 for the lost staff time and potential customer sales that resulted from this delay.
I opted to use your company’s services because you came highly recommended by a colleague, but based on this recent incident, I am tempted to look elsewhere for transport services in the future.
I hope we can come to an amicable resolution to this issue. I look forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,
Grace Manison
Produce Manager
Great Foods, Inc.
